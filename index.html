        <p>A total of 100 different odors in life are randomly collected in this website, each of which is transmitted to our brain nerves through the human sense of smell. In the EGG monitor, different odors form different alpha, beta and quadruple beta values. You can choose any one of these odors to understand its corresponding brain wave state.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, based on the experiment, we select keywords with high repetition rate, summarize and summarize them, and input them in midjourney's programming for AI painting. You can see the corresponding AI paintings in the link of each scent.</p>
        <p>Subsequently, we showed the AI paintings to people who did not participate in odor monitoring for keyword interviews. We finally found out through objective experiments that people who have not smelled odors can also feel the presence of odor objects through AI paintings. The experiment proves that generalization exists in people's sense of smell and vision, and even if they do not smell the relevant odor, they can still make each other perceive the odor through objective data.</p>
        <p>Tomosensory, can help us to heal as well as share the smell and convey the feeling ...</p>
